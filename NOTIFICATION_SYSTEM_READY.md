## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run SQL Migrations

You need to run TWO SQL scripts in Supabase SQL Editor:

#### A. Streak System Migration
```sql
-- Open Supabase → SQL Editor → New query
-- Copy and paste from: supabase-streak-migration.sql

ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS current_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS longest_streak INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_update_date DATE;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_last_update_date
  ON profiles(last_update_date);
```

#### B. Notification System Migration
```sql
-- Open Supabase → SQL Editor → New query
-- Copy and paste from: supabase-notifications-migration.sql

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  actor_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('like', 'comment', 'follow')),
  update_id UUID REFERENCES updates(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  comment_id UUID REFERENCES comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Plus indexes and RLS policies (see full file)
```

**IMPORTANT:** Don't delete your existing SQL! Use separate query tabs for each migration.

### Step 2: Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Open Dashboard
Go to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test Streak System
1. ✅ Check dashboard - should show current streak (0 at first)
2. ✅ Post an update - streak should increase to 1
3. ✅ Refresh dashboard - should see green success banner
4. ✅ Check tomorrow - should see orange warning banner if you haven't posted

### Test Notifications (Need 2 Users)
You'll need to test with a second account:

#### Setup Second User:
1. Open incognito window
2. Sign up with different email
3. Create a project and post an update

#### Test Like Notification:
1. User 2: Like User 1's update
2. User 1: Check bell icon - should show red badge with "1"
3. User 1: Click bell - should see "[User 2] liked your update"
4. User 1: Click notification - should navigate to update
5. User 1: Check bell - notification should be marked as read

#### Test Comment Notification:
1. User 2: Comment on User 1's update
2. User 1: Check bell - should show notification
3. User 1: Click notification - should navigate to update with comment

#### Test Follow Notification:
1. User 2: Follow User 1 (from feed or profile)
2. User 1: Check bell - should show notification
3. User 1: Click notification - should navigate to User 2's profile

#### Test Mark All as Read:
1. User 1: Have multiple unread notifications
2. Click "Mark all as read" button
3. Badge should disappear

## 🎨 UI Features

### Dashboard Streak Banner
- **Not updated today + have streak**: Orange warning banner with CTA
- **Updated today**: Green celebration banner with emoji and count

### Notification Bell
- **Badge**: Shows unread count (max 9+)
- **Dropdown**: Shows 5 most recent notifications
- **Each notification shows**:
  - Actor name (who triggered it)
  - Notification type and action
  - Preview of update content (if applicable)
  - Timestamp
- **Footer**: "View all notifications" link (for future full page)

## 📊 What's Working

✅ Build successful (no TypeScript errors)
✅ Streak calculation logic
✅ Notification creation on likes, comments, follows
✅ Notification deletion when actions are reversed (unlike, unfollow)
✅ Don't notify users for their own actions
✅ Real-time polling (30s interval)
✅ Proper database relationships with RLS policies

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

After testing notifications, you could add:
- 📸 Image upload for updates
- 📧 Email notifications
- 🏷️ Tags system
- 📊 Analytics dashboard
- 🔍 Advanced search

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Check Supabase SQL Editor** - make sure both migrations ran successfully
3. **Verify RLS policies** are enabled
4. **Try refreshing** the page
5. **Check network tab** to see if API calls are working
